This repository contains my Python solutions to common algorithmic problems, aimed at helping with coding interviews and competitive programming.

## Key Features

- Solutions for various classic problems like:
  - Two Sum
  - Add Two Numbers (linked list)
  - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
  - Binary Search Median
  - Merge Intervals
  - Quick Sort
- Both iterative and divide-and-conquer approaches for median finding.
- Readable code with helpful comments.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/LeetCode.git
   cd LeetCode
   ```

3. Run any solution directly. For instance:

   ```bash
   python q4_binary_search_median.py
   ```

**Gotcha:** Some scripts need you to instantiate classes or use methods with proper inputs.
