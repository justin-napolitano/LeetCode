I've been diving deep into algorithmic problems lately and thought it was about time to share my findings with the world. Enter my GitHub repository, [LeetCode](https://github.com/justin-napolitano/LeetCode)—a collection of Python solutions for some of the most common problems you’ll encounter in coding interviews and competitive programming.

## Why This Repo Exists

Coding interviews can be daunting. The pressure is high, and the problems can sometimes seem insurmountable. I built this repo to not only practice my coding skills but also to help others in the chaotic world of job hunting. My goal? Provide clear, concise implementations of classic algorithmic challenges. There’s nothing like having a solid reference to fall back on when you're prepping for those high-stakes questions.

## Key Design Decisions

When I set out to create this repo, I wanted it to be:

- **Straightforward**: Each problem solution is located in its own file. You shouldn’t have to sift through a jumbled mess of code to find what you need.
- **Readable**: Clean, understandable code is critical. I’ve included comments that explain my thought process and the logic behind the implementations.
- **Varied Approaches**: Whenever applicable, I’ve included multiple solution strategies. Take the median problem, for example; I explored both iterative and divide-and-conquer approaches. It’s about showing the different ways you can tackle the same problem.

## Stack & Tools

The entire project makes use of **Python 3**. Python is a fantastic language for algorithmic problems—its syntax is clean and it's widely accepted in interviews.

## Project Structure

The repo organizes each solution in a separate Python file, making navigation easy. Here’s a peek at what you’ll find:

- `q1_two_sum.py`: The iconic Two Sum problem.
- `q2_add_two_numbers_singly_linked_list.py`: A classic challenge where you add two numbers represented by singly linked lists.
- `q3_longest_substring.py`: Ever wanted to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters? This one's for you.
- `q4_binary_search_median.py`: Median calculation using binary search—efficient and elegant.
- `q4_merge_median.py`: The merge approach for median finding.
- `q_56_list_intersection.py`: Merges overlapping intervals—an essential skill.
- `quickSort.py`: A classic Quick Sort implementation.
- `README.md`: You’re reading it!

## How to Get Started

If you want to clone the repo (which you definitely should), just run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/LeetCode.git
cd LeetCode
```

To run any particular solution, it’s as easy as:

```bash
python q4_binary_search_median.py
```

Just remember, a handful of these files include classes and methods that require instantiation, so keep an eye out for that!

## Future Work / Roadmap

I'm not done yet! Here’s what's on my mind for future improvements:

-  **More Solutions**: I plan to expand the repository to cover an even broader range of algorithmic challenges. The more, the merrier, right?
-  **Unit Tests**: I want to add unit tests for each solution, which not only solidifies the reliability of the code but also encourages best practices.
-  **Optimizations**: Performance is key. I'll work on optimizing existing solutions and making them cleaner.
-  **Detailed Usage Examples**: Including specific input/output formats will help those who are new to these problems.
-  **Multi-language Support**: I’m seriously considering expanding the repo to include solutions in other programming languages like Java or C++. It’s always good to have options.

## Stay Updated

If you want to stay in the loop about updates, improvements, or just some ramblings from me, follow me on Mastodon, Bluesky, or Twitter/X. I love sharing insights and keeping the conversation going!

In short, my goal with this repo is to make your coding interview prep a tad bit easier. I hope these solutions prove valuable, and I’m excited about the improvements coming down the line. Time to code!
